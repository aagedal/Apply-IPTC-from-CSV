# Apply-IPTC-from-CSV
Match and embed IPTC metadata to images with metadata stored in csv.

1. Put the script in the same folder as the images and the metadata.csv file.
2. Run the script using python in the terminal. Uses Python installed using Homebrew, so will fail on non-macOS systems without modifications.

Used to match Bynder-metadata.
